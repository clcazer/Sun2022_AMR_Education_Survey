# Sun2022_AMR_Education_Survey

This package reproduces analysis found in "Veterinary Students’ Knowledge and Awareness of Antimicrobial Stewardship before and after Clinical Rotations". The analysis of student pathway interest (e.g., small animal, production animal, etc.) is not reproduced here because it requires identifiable data. The small number of students in some pathways could risk re-identification and the data here is grouped into "small animal" and "other". The student ID has also been re-coded to prevent re-identification.

Step 1. Open R Project File 'Sun2022_AMR_Education_Survey.Rproj', then getwd() to check that the path of this project file is the active directory. Step 2. In R, open the "R code for AMR Education_reproducible.R" file and source/run it with echo.

De-identified data is in the data folder.
